## Exercise 1
Writing in Markdown is _not_ that hard!

I **will** complete these lessons!

"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: *VIVE L'IRLANDE*!

* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes

1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

* Azalea (*Ericaceae Rhododendron*)
* Chrysanthemum (*Anthemideae Chrysanthemum*)
* Dahlia (*Coreopsideae Dahlia*)

* Calculus
 * A professor
 * Has no hair
 * Often wears green
* Castafiore
 * An opera singer
 * Has white hair
 * Is possibly mentally unwell

1. Cut the cheese
 
 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

 Be careful when holding the knife.

 For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2
**Scribe** (markup language)
>Scribe is a markup language and word processing system that pioneered the use of descriptive markup.  
Scribe was revolutionary when it was proposed, because it involved for the first time a clean separation of presentation and content.  
>
>Using Scribe involved a two phase process:
>
>* Typing a manuscript file using any text editor, conforming to the Scribe markup.
>* Processing this file through the Scribe compiler to generate an associated document file, which can be printed.
>
>The Scribe markup language defined the words, lines, pages, spacing, headings, footings, footnotes, numbering, tables of contents, etc. in a way similar to HTML. The Scribe compiler used a database of Styles (containing document format definitions), which defined the rules for formatting a document in a particular style.
>
>Because of the separation between the content (structure) of the document, and its style (format), writers did not need to concern themselves with the details of formatting. In this, there are similarities to the LaTeX document preparation system by Leslie Lamport.

**Standard Generalized Markup Language** (markup language)  
_The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML; ISO 8879:1986) is a standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents. ISO 8879 Annex A.1 states that generalized markup is "based on two postulates"_:  
* _Declarative: Markup should describe a document's structure and other attributes rather than specify the processing that needs to be performed, because it is less likely to conflict with future developments_.
* _Rigorous: In order to allow markup to take advantage of the techniques available for processing markup should rigorously define objects like programs and databases_.

## Exercise 4

```
public class Person  
{ 
  private string name;  
  private int age;  
  public Person(string initialName)  
  {  
    this.age = 0;  
    this.name = initialName;  
  }  
  public void PrintPerson()  
  {  
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");  
  }  
  public void GrowOlder()  
  {  
    this.age = this.age + 1;  
  }  
}
```
